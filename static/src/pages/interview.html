                    <dd class="mb-8 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['CJ']">Hey, my name’s Chris Jack and I am the founder & director of Story, South Africa’s Premium Sneaker, Apparel &
                    Collectibles Marketplace Store, as well as Sneaker Stories TV, a review channel for all things sneaker.</dd>
                    <dt class="font-medium mb-4 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['SL']">Tell us more about Story and why you started it?</dt>
                    <dd class="mb-0 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['CJ']">Story was born out of a growing necessity for a safe & secure marketplace for people to buy and sell their sneakers, streetwear & the likes in South Africa.
                    <br /><br />
                    Through my pages & YouTube channel, I realised that there was an ever-growing need for this as the culture was being too often exploited by “fake companies” trying to scam unsuspecting customers with knock-off products.
                    <br /><br />
                    The majority of shoes I feature on my channel are rare, collectible & not easily available to purchase at retail level, which creates an ideal opportunity for people to get caught out with paying a premium for something that isn’t
                    authentic.
                    <br /><br />
                    So to close this loop, essentially, I wanted to create a space that took the negative out of the equation, while
                    offering sneaker and streetwear enthusiasts a place they could buy and sell stress-free, all while learning more about product, in an experience that rivals our international counterparts.</dd>

                    <dd class="mb-8 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['CJ']">My love for sneakers started through DJing and having an opportunity with adidas on a global campaign they were running. Long story short, I was given access to some amazing pairs to wear on a tour and the rest is history.</dd>
                    <dt class="font-medium mb-4 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['SL']">Tell us about the importance of caring for your sneakers?</dt>
                    <dd class="mb-8 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['CJ']">Sneakers for me have always represented more than just the leather & rubber that constitutes them. I consider some pairs
                    of mine, complete works of art and like any piece of art, it’s important to keep them in the best condition at all
                    times.

                    <dd class="mb-8 pl-16 md:pl-8 relative before:absolute before:left-0 before:content-['CJ']">Sneaker Wipes, in my opinion, are one of the greatest inventions ever. I take pretty good care of my shoes when wearing them, but the inevitable splash of dirt or a scuff here and there immediately puts those kicks at the back of the pile. With Wipes, I can clean my pair on the go and have them looking brand new without the hassle of a full cleaning process.
